** Deployment

 + Remote deploy from x86 to aarch64 needs binfmt on host. Could not
   get it to run with wsl-guix or guix on foreign distribution on
   wsl2. The only option that seems to work is to start the daemon
   with `--disable-chroot`. However after this deployment will fail
   with `guix deploy: error: failed to deploy pi4: missing modules for
   #<file-system-label "RASPIROOT">: uio_pdrv_genirq`. Workaround is
   described [[https://www.mail-archive.com/search?l=help-guix@gnu.org&q=subject:%22Re%5C%3A+Guix+deploy+fails+claiming+some+module+missing%22&o=newest&f=1][here]].
